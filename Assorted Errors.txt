  File "/Users/ThomasJamesEdstrom/Web_Projects/CodingDojo/Python/Flask_and_MySQL/Examples/friends/venv/lib/python2.7/site-packages/flask/exthook.py", line 110, in load_module
    raise ImportError('No module named %s' % fullname)
ImportError: No module named flask.ext.sqlalchemy

so.. I ran:

	pip install Flask-SQLAlchemy

while my virtualenv was active and that seems to have fixed it





Then I was getting:

	    return __import__('MySQLdb')
	ImportError: No module named MySQLdb

So I ran:
	
	pip install MySQL-python

and finally I got it to run
